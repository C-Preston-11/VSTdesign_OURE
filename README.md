Custom Audio Effect Plugins in MATLAB

An OURE Research Project
Project Overview

This repository contains MATLAB-based audio effect plugins designed for digital signal processing (DSP) research. The project focuses on:

    Designing modular audio effects (e.g., distortion, reverb, filters).

    Exploring psychoacoustic principles for creative sound manipulation.

    Optimizing real-time performance for potential integration with DAWs (e.g., via VST or Audio Toolbox).

Features

✅ Core Effects:

    Dynamic range compression

    Granular synthesis

    Nonlinear distortion

    FIR/IIR filter design

✅ Tools:

    GUI-based parameter tuning (appdesigner).

    Spectral analysis (FFT, spectrograms).

    Real-time audio I/O (using audioDeviceReader/audioDeviceWriter).

✅ Custom Modules:

    ModularSynth.m: A framework for chaining effects.

    PsychoacousticModeling.m: Perceptual optimization of effects
