Custom Audio Effect Plugins in MATLAB

An OURE Research Project
Project Overview

This repository contains MATLAB-based audio effect plugins designed for digital signal processing (DSP) research. The project focuses on:

    Designing modular audio effects (e.g., distortion, reverb, filters).

    Exploring psychoacoustic principles for creative sound manipulation.

    Optimizing real-time performance for potential integration with DAWs (e.g., via VST or Audio Toolbox).

Features

✅ Core Effects:

    Variable order FIR LPF (window method)
    
    Variable order IIR LPF

    Variable resonance IIR LPF (second-order)

    Ping-Pong Delay 

    Reverberator (Schroeder algorithm)

✅ Tools:

    GUI-based parameter tuning

    Spectral analysis (FFT, spectrograms)

    Real-time audio I/O (using audioDeviceReader/audioDeviceWriter)
